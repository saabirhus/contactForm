Today is Thursday 4th May and I will be building this contact form for a personal project that i failed to complete a while ago. I wanted to start afresh and see if I can still complete it to a good standard. My aim is to never finish this project because there is something i can do to improve it or change it. I will log any improvement/update I make in this readME file so that I can look back at this in the future.

Update 1(4th May 2024);
At the moment, I have have the html for the website and the css as well. I will aim to finish the javascript soon so that I can error handle and whatnot. In the future, i would like to be able to save data in a file or in an online databse.
